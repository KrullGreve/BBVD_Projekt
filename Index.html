            <h3>BIG BAD VOODOO DADDY <br> 25TH ANNIVERSARY TOUR <br> IN FULL SWING</h3>
            <p>Since forming in the early nineties, the Ventura, California contemporary swing <br> band Big Bad Voodoo Daddy has toured virtually non-stop and 2018 is no exception. <br> In their 25 years together, the original seven-piece group of talented
                swing <br> musicians have played over 3000 shows and produced a sizable catalog of recorded <br> music over the years with sales of nearly three million albums to date. Their <br> musical imprint is made by blending a vibrant fusion of
                the classic American <br> sounds of jazz, swing, and dixieland, with the energy and spirit of contemporary <br> culture.</p>
            <p>The band first received recognition when they were featured in the 1996 cult hit <br> film, "Swingers," a movie that introduced Big Bad Voodoo Daddy to an audience <br> beyond their southern California roots. Big Bad Voodoo Daddy's music has
                appeared <br> in countless more films and television shows, including The Wild, Despicable <br> Me, Phineas & Ferb, FRIENDS (TV Show), 3rd Rock from the Sun, Ally McBeal, and <br> So You Think You Can Dance.</p>
            <p>Big Bad Voodoo Daddy's all original core line-up includes Scotty Morris (lead vocals <br> and guitar), Kurt Sodergren (drums), Dirk Shumaker (double bass and vocals), Andy <br> Rowley (baritone saxophone and vocals), Glen "The Kid" Marhevka
                (trumpet), Karl <br> Hunter (saxophones and clarinet) and Joshua Levy (piano and arranger). </p>

            <h3>Vocals & Guitar</h3>
            <p>Big Bad Voodoo Daddy singer / songwriter Scotty Morris has spent the last two and a half decades committed to writing and performing original and classic American jazz and swing music. The band, formed by Morris in Ventura, California in 1989,
                was named "Big Bad Voodoo Daddy" after Scotty met Texas blues guitar legend Albert Collins at one of the latter's concerts. "He signed my poster 'To Scotty, the big bad voodoo daddy.' I thought it was the greatest name I had ever heard
                on one of the greatest musical nights of my life. So when it came time to name this band, I didn't really have a choice. I felt like it was handed down to me."

            <h3>Drums & Percussion</h3>
            <p>Co-founder Kurt Sodergren's 20 plus year career as the drummer for Big Bad Voodoo Daddy was a natural fit — his grandfather played in swing and jazz bands most of his life including a stint with the US Army Big Band during WWII. Shortly after
                meeting Scotty Morris in the late 80's, they formed Big Bad Voodoo Daddy as a trio, soon expanding the lineup and adding jazz elements to their already gritty blues format. More than two decades later Kurt's favorite moments remain playing
                new venues and the now de rigueur post show meet and greet. "It's a great way to stay connected to our fans and form a sort of patchwork family across the country."
